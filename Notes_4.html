Active and Passive Voice

Active Voice के वाक्यों में Subject भी दिया गया होता है और ये भी बताया गया होता है कि Subject किस क्रिया को कर रहा है। जितने भी वाक्य आपने Tense और Modal Verb के लैसन में आपने पढ़े थे वो सभी Active Voice में थे क्योंकि सभी में Subject और Subject की क्रिया दोनों के बारे में बताया गया था।
Passive Voice के वाक्यों में क्रिया के बारे में बताया गया होता है लेकिन उस क्रिया को करने वाले Subject के बारे में या तो बताया नहीं गया होता या फिर “द्वारा” के साथ बताया गया होता है। एक महत्वपूर्ण बात और कि Passive Voice के वाक्यों में हमेशा Verb की 3rd form का प्रयोग किया जाता है।

उदाहरण –

मैं रवि से पूछ रहा हूँ।
यह वाक्य Active Voice में है, क्योंकि यहाँ पर की जाने वाली क्रिया (पूछना) Subject (मैं) कर रहा हूँ।

रवि को पूछा जा रहा है।
यह वाक्य Passive Voice में है, क्योंकि यहाँ पर “पूछ्ने” का काम कौन कर रहा है, ये बताया ही नहीं गया है।

रवि को मेरे द्वारा पूछा जा रहा है।
यह वाक्य भी Passive Voice में है, क्योंकि यहाँ पर “पूछ्ने” का काम जो कर रहा है, वो हूँ मैं, लेकिन मेरे बारे में “द्वारा” के साथ बताया गया है।
